            <em>Potassium and kalium for the growing developer</em>
            <p>Bananacamp is a webapplication/site that helps with managing and maintaining a bootcamp.<br>
            The initial setup is specifically targetted towards bootcamps that aspire to train attendees to become full stack developers.
            The name <em>bananacamp</em> came about after watching Douglas Crockford's Google Tech Talk "JavaScript The Good Parts", in which he famously said (about object oriented programming):<br><br>
            <i>"All you wanted was a banana, but instead you got a gorilla holding the banana and the entire jungle with it".</i></p>

              Participants can be expected to write code that demonstrates their understanding of the basic concepts of programming. That is: participants understand the concepts of variables, conditionals, and loops
