                <p>Bananacamp is a webapplication/site that helps with managing and maintaining a bootcamp.<br>
                The initial setup is specifically targetted towards bootcamps that aspire to train attendees to become full stack developers.
                The name <em>bananacamp</em> came about after watching Douglas Crockford's Google Tech Talk "JavaScript The Good Parts", in which he famously said (about object oriented programming):<br><br>
                <em>"All you wanted was a banana, but instead you got a gorilla holding the banana and the entire jungle with it".</em></p>
                <p>This project was developed while studying to become full stack developers at a bootcamp organised by CodeGorilla (tm).</p>
